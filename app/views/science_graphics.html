          <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
          <p class="par-text">
            Data generated by measurements, analysis or calculation often needs to be plotted. This article will show how that can be done in 2D and 3D and why current tools like <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">flot</a> or <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> usually do not fit this purpose. The focus lays on the display and fast rendering. Sophisticated buffer handling is also will not be part of this article. Synchronizing and minifying data sets is also out of scope.

          <h3>What is wrong with a 2D canvas?</h3>
          <p class="par-text">
            Tools that are available open source use the 2D canvas for rendering. This is good if only one plot is drawn, the update rate is low or the client does not support webgl rendering. There is some graphics acceleration support for 2D canvases. It is better than nothing but not even close to webgl rendering of a scene. Drawing lines e.g. is really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Wu%27s_line_algorithm">expensive</a> when the line width exceeds 1. Moreover, buffer handling of <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">flot</a> creates lots of garbage by design of the interface. Stressing the garbage collector should be avoided when trying to do something fast. A webgl tool would be a fine solution. There is just none. The biggest webgl framework is <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, which allows to write own webgl programs without shader knowledge. However, it is a framework designed for arbitrary webgl applications and oversized for just rendering coordinate systems and lines.

          <h3>Simple shaders</h3>
          <p class="par-text">
            For demo purposes, I started <a href="https://github.com/markert/wegli.js">wegli.js</a>. The examples are generated with this little framework. If you like to do something fast and in the way no need it, you usually must do lots of the stuff yourself. Especially, when it comes to displays, available libraries always have drawbacks.

          <p class="par-text">
            For drawing a line with webgl, you start with creating a webgl canvas. You can then add shader programs to the canvas that actually do something. A line consists of vertices and colors. Every vertex has a color. Between vertices with different color, a gradient will be calculated and drawn. Every program has two shaders. The vertex shader does positioning, movement and matrix coordinate translation. The fragment shader does coloring and texturing. Variables are passed from the JS program to the vertex shader and can be transmitted to the fragment shader from the vertex shader. For a colored line consisting of two points, two coordinates and two color vectors must be passed to the vertex shader. The vertex shader then passes the color to the fragment shader. Both shaders are calculated for every vertex. Global variables like the coordinate transformation are passed as uniforms once and have the same value for every calculated vertex. Passing values to the shader is done by a buffer in a predefined structure. For a better understanding do some tutorials or have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/markert/wegli.js/blob/master/src/polygonshader.js">wegli.js shader code</a>.

            Note: All frequency domain plots show the FFT of noise added to two sine waves with different amplitudes and frequencies. Surfaces have 512x256 pixels. The time displayed is the time consumed by rendering without FFT calculations, which consume most of the time.

          <h3>Heatmaps</h3>
          <p class="par-text">
            A heatmap is a 2D plot that introduces a third dimension represented by the color of each pixel. Common heatmaps have a color range from blue to red or from black to white. When plotting a function or wave in a heatmap, pixel color is increased when the function overlays a pixel. Pxiels can age by decreasing every pixel by a predefined value for every rendering iteration. To achieve a heatmap behavior in webgl, a 2D pixel map is defined by filling a buffer with the respective vertices. The color of every vertex is set to an initial color. Every time the scene gets redrawn, it must check which pixels are overlayed and increase the color. Aging of every pixel can be done by the <a href="https://github.com/markert/wegli.js/blob/master/src/heatmapshader.js">shader</a>. Webgl buffers are located in the memory space of the graphics card. In order to reduce the memory bandwidth needed, webgl buffers can be rewritten partially. So, if only a few pixels must be increased in color, memory must only be written at the respective positions. A simple trick to decrease memory bandwidth and CPU usage is, to leave the color calculation to the graphics card. The color algorithm is implemented in the fragment shader and depends on the z-position of the pixel. Another advantage of that method is that a 3D display can be achieved by a simple matrix transformation of the viewport.

          <h3>Waterfall Diagrams</h3>
          <p class="par-text">
            Waterfall diagrams are similar to heatmaps when it comes to rendering. Therefore, the same fragment <a href="https://github.com/markert/wegli.js/blob/master/src/heatmapshader.js">shader</a> is used and only the vertex shader differs. In a waterfall diagram, only the first column gets rendered with new z-values. All other columns move one pixel to the left or right. These diagrams are useful to display frequency data over the time. Frequency drift can be identified easily. When viewing the scene in 3D, usually a surface is what people like to see. The buffer structure of the example does not provide this functionality. To render a surface, a TRANGLE_STRIP must be used for the renderer and the buffer must be filled <a href="http://www.learnopengles.com/tag/triangle-strips/">accordingly</a>.

          <h3>Writing Text</h3>
          <p class="par-text">
            Writing text is an easy task in most drawing environments. In webgl it is not, since there simply is no interface for writing text. To add text to a webgl scene, a texture must be designed and then pasted to a rectangle with transparent background. This can be done by generating a 2D canvas and writing text to that. The canvas can then be transformed to a webgl texture and be plotted. Transferring the texture to the graphics memory is expensive. A texture buffer is useful that stores textures that have already been rendered. The example uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms">least recently used</a> queue to implement that buffer. Implementing a texture <a href="https://github.com/markert/wegli.js/blob/master/src/textureshader.js">shader</a> provides the possibility to load arbitrary other textures like logos from a 2D canvas.

          <h3>3D plotting</h3>
          <p class="par-text">
            Plotting data with many fps in 3D is clase to impossible in 2D canvases. A webgl context is the only way to go when getting into the third dimension. A webgl context does not make any difference between 2D or 3D. In fact it is always 3D. The coordinate system consists of x, y and z. 2D can be achieved by setting z to 0. For 3D plotting, every pixel is coordinate is multiplied by one or more projection matrices. The projection matrices are usually constant for a shader since the whole object shall be transformed to the new coordinates. the common projection modes for a webgl scene are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection">perspective or orthographic projection</a>. The wegli.js library uses a projection matrix that is <a href="https://github.com/markert/wegli.js/blob/master/src/glutils.js">calculated</a> from a higher order description that contains translaten, rotation and other variables. When dealing with 3D, the graphics card must calculate which pixels are visible and which are covered from other objects from the screens point of view. It also must take transparency into account. The behavior can be changed by depthTest or blend functions.
